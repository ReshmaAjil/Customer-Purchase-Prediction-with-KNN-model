KNN Classification Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python and scikit-learn.

Overview

Predicts customer purchase behavior using Age and Monthly Spend

Includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data patterns

Applies feature scaling for distance-based learning

Uses cross-validation to select the optimal value of K

Evaluates performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

Key Concepts Covered

KNN working principle

Importance of scaling in KNN

Hyperparameter tuning (K selection)

Elbow method interpretation

Model evaluation metrics

Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

Purpose

This project is intended for learning and practice, focusing on understanding KNN, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning rather than production deployment.
